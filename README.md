# Misinformation Detection and Fact-Checking on Social Media

#### Misinformation spreads six times faster than accurate information on social media.
This issue became more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic, when social media became the primary means of communication. During this time, many false claims emerged, such as conspiracy theories suggesting that the virus was a biological weapon created by China or that there was no pandemic at all and the government was misleading the public. Such misinformation exacerbated the situation.
This is one incident that highlights the importance of having access to accurate information about the world. Misinformation is not limited to the pandemic; it is prevalent in various sectors, including education and healthcare, putting especially young audiences at risk.
There are two potential solutions to address this problem. The first is to establish a trusted platform for information. However, this may be challenging, as even major platforms like Facebook struggle to reduce misinformation due to their reliance on monetization; sensational or false information often attracts more engagement, which is detrimental to their revenue.
#### The second solution could involve creating a model or application that evaluates information and provides a percentage indicating its likelihood of being true or false.
